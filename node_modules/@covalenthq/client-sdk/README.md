# Covalent SDK for TypeScript

The Covalent SDK is the fastest way to integrate the Covalent Unified API for working with blockchain data. The SDK works with all [supported chains](https://www.covalenthq.com/docs/networks/) including Mainnets and Testnets. 

**Note - Require `Node v18` and above for best results.**

> **Sign up for an API Key**
>
> To get your own Covalent API key, **[sign up here](https://www.covalenthq.com/platform/auth/register/)** and create your key from the *API Keys* tab.

## Getting started

```
npm install @covalenthq/client-sdk
```
or
```
yarn add @covalenthq/client-sdk
```

## How to use the Covalent SDK

**Video Tutorial**: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSpPJP2w62E&ab_channel=Covalent

After installing, you can import and use the SDK with:

```ts
import { CovalentClient, Chains } from "@covalenthq/client-sdk";

const ApiServices = async () => {
    const client = new CovalentClient("YOUR_API_KEY"); // Replace with your Covalent API key.

    const balanceResp = await client.BalanceService.getTokenBalancesForWalletAddress("eth-mainnet", "WALLET_ADDRESS");
    if (!balanceResp.error) {
        console.log(balanceResp.data);
    } else {
        console.log(balanceResp.error_message);
    }
}
```
> **Name Resolution**
>
> The Covalent SDK natively supports ENS domains (e.g. `demo.eth`), Lens Handles (e.g. `@demo.lens`) and Unstoppable Domains (e.g. `demo.x`) which automatically resolve to the underlying user address (e.g. `0xfC43f5F9dd45258b3AFf31Bdbe6561D97e8B71de`)

**ℹ️ BREAKING CHANGE**
> If you have been importing with `Client`: 
```ts 
import { Client } from "@covalenthq/client-sdk";
```
>
> Please change to `CovalentClient`:
```ts
import { CovalentClient } from "@covalenthq/client-sdk";
```

### How to apply supported query parameters to endpoints
Query parameters are handled using `typed objects`. To pass in query parameters, developers can define an object that follows the type listed in the provided `tsdocs` under `src/util/types/`. Additionally, developers can reference the `tsdocs` for autocomplete suggestions for the supported parameters. These supported parameters can be passed in any order. 

For example, the following sets the `quoteCurrency` query parameter to `CAD` and the parameter `nft` to `true` for fetching all the token balances, including NFTs, for a wallet address:
```ts
const resp = await client.BalanceService.getTokenBalancesForWalletAddress("eth-mainnet", "WALLET_ADDRESS", {quoteCurrency: "CAD", nft: true});
```
### Assign Types
You can import types for each endpoint, found here `src/util/types/`. Here is an example:
```ts
import { CovalentClient, BalancesResponse,  BalanceItem } from "@covalenthq/client-sdk";
const resp = await client.BalanceService.getTokenBalancesForWalletAddress("eth-mainnet", "WALLET_ADDRESS", {quoteCurrency: "CAD", nft: true});
const data: BalancesResponse = resp.data; // `resp.data` in this case is of type `BalancesResponse`
const items: BalanceItem[] = resp.data.items; // `resp.data.items` is of type `BalanceItem[]`
```

### Different ways to input chains in chain fields
We offer users three options for specifying a chain in the designated field:

1. String literal - directly inputting the chain name, such as `eth-mainnet`, with auto-completion functionality as the user types.
2. Chain Enum - utilizing the Chain enum `Chains.ETH_MAINNET`, which provides auto-suggestions as the user types in the chain field.
3. Chain Id - entering the ChainId as a numerical value.

Example with string literal
```ts
// Example call with string literal  ("eth-mainnet")
const respWithStringLiteral = await client.BalanceService.getTokenBalancesForWalletAddress("eth-mainnet", "WALLET_ADDRESS");
```
Example with Chain Enum
```ts
// Example call with enum  (Chains.ETH_MAINNET)
const respWithEnum = await client.BalanceService.getTokenBalancesForWalletAddress(Chains.ETH_MAINNET, "WALLET_ADDRESS");
```
Example with Chain Id
```ts
// Example call with chain Id  (1)
const respWithChainId = await client.BalanceService.getTokenBalancesForWalletAddress(1, "WALLET_ADDRESS");
```

## Supported Endpoints

The Covalent SDK provides comprehensive support for all Class A, Class B, and Pricing endpoints that are grouped under the following *Service* namespaces:

- [`SecurityService`](#securityservice): Access to the token approvals endpoints

The functions `getAllTransactionsForAddressByPage()`, `getTransactionsForAddressV3()`, and `getTimeBucketTransactionsForAddress()` have been enhanced with the introduction of `next()` and `prev()` support functions. These functions facilitate a smoother transition for developers navigating through our links object, which includes `prev` and `next` fields. Instead of requiring developers to manually extract values from these fields and create JavaScript API fetch calls for the URL values, the new `next()` and `prev()` functions provide a streamlined approach, allowing developers to simulate this behavior more efficiently.

```ts
import { CovalentClient } from "@covalenthq/client-sdk";

const client = new CovalentClient("YOUR_API_KEY"); // Replace with your Covalent API key.
const resp = await client.TransactionService.getAllTransactionsForAddressByPage("eth-mainnet", "WALLET_ADDRESS");
// assuming resp.data.current_page is 10
if (resp.data !== null) {
    const prevPage = await resp.data.prev() // will retrieve page 9
    console.log(prevPage.data)
}
```

### XykService

- `getHealthData()`: Ping the health of xy=k endpoints to get the synced block height per chain.

## Additional Helper Functions
### calculatePrettyBalance
The `calculatePrettyBalance` function is designed to take up to 4 inputs: the `balance` field obtained from the `tokenBalance` endpoint and the `contract_decimals`. The function also includes two optional fields, `roundOff` and `precision`, to allow developers to round the unscaled balance to a certain decimal precision. The primary purpose of this function is to convert the scaled token balance (the balance parameter) into its unscaled, human-readable form. The scaled balance needs to be divided by 10^(contractDecimals) to remove the scaling factor.

```ts
import { CovalentClient, calculatePrettyBalance } from "@covalenthq/client-sdk";

const client = new CovalentClient("YOUR_API_KEY"); // Replace with your Covalent API key.
const resp = await client.BalanceService.getTokenBalancesForWalletAddress("eth-mainnet", "WALLET_ADDRESS");
const prettyBalance = calculatePrettyBalance(resp.data.items[0].balance, resp.data.items[0].contract_decimals);
```
### prettifyCurrency
The `prettifyCurrency` function refines the presentation of a monetary value, accepting a numerical amount and a fiat currency code as parameters (with USD as the default currency). It simplifies currency formatting for developers, ensuring visually polished representations of financial information in user interfaces for an enhanced user experience.

```ts
import { CovalentClient, prettifyCurrency } from "@covalenthq/client-sdk";

const client = new CovalentClient("YOUR_API_KEY"); // Replace with your Covalent API key.
const resp = await client.BalanceService.getTokenBalancesForWalletAddress("eth-mainnet", "WALLET_ADDRESS");
const prettyCurrency = prettifyCurrency(resp.data.items[0].quote_rate);
```

## Built-in SDK Features
### Explaining Pagination Mechanism Within the SDK

The following endpoints support pagination:

- `getErc20TransfersForWalletAddress()`
- `getTokenHoldersV2ForTokenAddress()`
- `getBlockHeights()`
- `getLogEventsByAddress()`
- `getLogEventsByTopicHash()`
- `getChainCollections()`
- `getTokenIdsForContractWithMetadata()`
- `getAllTransactionsForAddress()`

Using the Covalent API, paginated supported endpoints return only 100 items, such as transactions or log events, per page. However, the Covalent SDK leverages generators to *seamlessly fetch all items without the user having to deal with pagination*. 

For example, the following fetches ALL transactions for `demo.eth` on Ethereum:
```ts
import { CovalentClient } from "@covalenthq/client-sdk";

const ApiServices = async () => {
    const client = new CovalentClient("YOUR_API_KEY"); // Replace with your Covalent API key.
    try {
        for await (const tx of client.TransactionService.getAllTransactionsForAddress("eth-mainnet", "demo.eth")) {
            console.log("tx", tx);
        }
    } catch (error) {
        console.log(error.message);
    }
}
```

### Concurrency Mechanism

Developers have the flexibility to specify the desired number of concurrent API calls they wish to execute using the `threadCount` settings parameter, with a default value of `3`. For example:

```ts
import { CovalentClient, CovalentClientSettings } from "@covalenthq/client-sdk";

const settings: CovalentClientSettings = {
    threadCount: 5
}

const ApiServices = async () => {
    const client = new CovalentClient("YOUR_API_KEY", settings); // Replace with your Covalent API key and add set debugger
    const resp = await client.BalanceService.getTokenBalancesForWalletAddress("eth-mainnet", "WALLET_ADDRESS");
    if (!resp.error) {
        console.log(resp.data);
    } else {
        console.log(resp.error_message);
    }
}
```

### Debugger Mode

Developers have the option to enable a debugger mode that provides response times, the URLs of called endpoints, and the HTTP statuses of those endpoints. This feature helps users identify which endpoints may have encountered failures. The default is `debug = false` if no input is provided.

```ts
import { CovalentClient, CovalentClientSettings } from "@covalenthq/client-sdk";

const settings: CovalentClientSettings = {
    debug: true
}

const ApiServices = async () => {
    const client = new CovalentClient("YOUR_API_KEY", settings); // Replace with your Covalent API key and add set debugger
    const resp = await client.BalanceService.getTokenBalancesForWalletAddress("eth-mainnet", "WALLET_ADDRESS");
    if (!resp.error) {
        console.log(resp.data);
    } else {
        console.log(resp.error_message);
    }
}
```

![example result image](https://www.datocms-assets.com/86369/1697154621-sdk-debugger-output.png)

### Retry Mechanism

Each endpoint is equipped with an exponential backoff algorithm that exponentially extends the wait time between retries, up to a `maximum of 5` retry attempts.

Users have the ability to control the retry feature through the enableRetry configuration setting. By default, this feature is enabled `true`. However, users can deactivate it by setting `enableRetry` to `false`.

```ts
import { CovalentClient, CovalentClientSettings } from "@covalenthq/client-sdk";

const settings: CovalentClientSettings = {
    enableRetry: false
}
```

### Error Handling
The paginated endpoints throw an error message in this format: `An error occurred {error_code}: {error_message}`. The developer will need to `catch` these errors. Note - these endpoints do not follow the default response format which is:
```ts
❴ 
    "data": ...,
    "error": false,
    "error_message": null,
    "error_code": null
❵
```

### Error codes
Covalent uses standard HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request. In general: codes in the 2xx range indicate success. Codes in the 4xx range indicate an error that failed given the information provided (e.g., a required parameter was omitted, etc.). Codes in the 5xx range indicate an error with Covalent's servers (these are rare).

| Code      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| 200      | OK	Everything worked as expected.       |
| 400   | Bad Request	The request could not be accepted, usually due to a missing required parameter.        |
| 401   | Unauthorized	No valid API key was provided.        |
| 404   | Not Found	The request path does not exist.        |
| 429   | Too Many Requests	You are being rate-limited. Please see the rate limiting section for more information.        |
| 500, 502, 503   | Server Errors	Something went wrong on Covalent's servers. These are rare.        |

## Tests
to run all tests, you need to input your api key first shown below
```
COVALENT_API_KEY=YOUR_KEY npm test
```
OR

you can run individual tests for each service, for example
```
COVALENT_API_KEY=YOUR_KEY npm test -- security-service.test.ts
```

## Documentation

The Covalent API SDK documentation is integrated within the source code through `tsdoc` comments. When utilizing an Integrated Development Environment (IDE), the SDK provides generated types and accompanying documentation for seamless reference and usage.
